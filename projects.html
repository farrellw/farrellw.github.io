								<h4>Raspberry Drive - Autonomous Car</h4>
								<p>Raspberry Drive was completed as an 8-day final project at Dev Bootcamp.  Our group of four had zero experience working with any of the equipment needed, but we had an idea:  <strong> Build a car that can drive itself</strong>.<br><br>  The unique challenge was a gaurantee that our team would learn something totally new.  Continous challenges throughout the project are what drove us (and eventually the car).<br><br> 

								<strong>Challenge 1: Where to start?</strong><br>
								Answer: Research everything, buy three cheap RC cars from the local Target, start breaking them apart and looking inside.

								<br><br> 

								<strong>Challenge 2: How to get get the Raspberry Pi to turn the wheels on the car. </strong><br>
								Answer: Mimicing the radio signal?  We figured out the frequency but it was unreliable.  Wire straight into the motor?  You lose your power source. 

								Our team ended up wiring one Raspberry Pi into the circuit-board of the RC car's controller, pic shown.  We completed the circuits with transistors which would open and closed based on a tiny bit of electricity flowing out of the Raspberry Pi's ports (which we could open). <br><br>  Then we took a separate Raspberry Pi, attached it to a camera and quite literally masking taped it to the top of the car.

								<p><strong>Challenge 3: Everything works.  Nothing works together.</strong>  <br>One of our Pi's can tell the car to spin its wheels.  The other Pi can run a script that continually takes pictures.  Our Server(aka my computer) SSH's into the Controller Pi and says "open a socket, listen for my command".  Then it SSH's into the Camera Pi and says, "Don't worry about anything else.  Just start taking pictures every 1/10 second". Both of these processes were run in Python threads and as background jobs so the image analysis could take place. </p>

								<p> Once all systems were up and running, the driving could begin.  The main-server SCPs into the Camera-Pi and grabs the most recent picture.  When it has the picture, it analyzes the picture using custom OpenCV logic and determines a driving command based on what it sees.  Next, the server sends the command to the controller Pi over the open port that has been listening for instrucitons the whole time. </p> <br><br>

								<p><strong>Challenge 4: How do we find obstacles?</strong>  <br>Check out the image recognition code.  Essentially the car could isolate colors/shapes and steer depending on what it saw.  Anyone wanting to check out Raspberry Pi, Autonomous Cars, Image Recognition software, Python asynchronous threads, go ahead and contact! </p>
